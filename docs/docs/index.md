# Welcome to the Uh!ive Python SDK

The Uh!ive Python SDK is a library to access our live Automated Speech Recognition online APIs.
It provides [I/O Free](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/index.html) Python abstractions over the underlying protocols and workflows to hide the complexity.

By providing an I/O Free implementation, we let developers choose whatever websocket transport library and paradigm — synchronous or asynchronous (asyncio) — they like most.
