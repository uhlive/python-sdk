# *** Phoenix channel protocol V2 ***
#
# This is a non-official "specification" translated from Phoenix source code.
#
# Compared to the V1 protocol.
#
# * A new message field has been added: `join_ref`, which is the `ref` string when joining. We use "0".
# * JSON messages: instead of an object that names the fields, V2 sends a list
#   (i.e parameters are passed by position instead of being passed by name) in this order:
#      join_ref, ref, topic, event_name, payload
# * We now have a binary version represented as (using erlang binary patterns):
# <<
#  @push::size(8),
#  join_ref_size::size(8),
#  ref_size::size(8),
#  topic_size::size(8),
#  event_size::size(8),
#  join_ref::binary-size(join_ref_size),
#  ref::binary-size(ref_size),
#  topic::binary-size(topic_size),
#  event::binary-size(event_size),
#  data::binary
# >>
# where @push = 0
