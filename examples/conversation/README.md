# Example scripts for the conversation API


To run the scripts, you'll need to set some environment variables:
```
export UHLIVE_API_TOKEN=a-valid-token
export UHLIVE_API_URL=wss://api.uh.live/
```

And then:

```
python examples/<python_script>.py -h
```


Note that you must use the right token for the right entrypoint URL.
