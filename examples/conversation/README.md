# Example scripts for the conversation API


To run the scripts, you'll need to set some environment variables:
```
export UHLIVE_API_CLIENT=a-valid-client-identifier
export UHLIVE_API_SECRET=secret-pass-code
```

And then:

```
python examples/<python_script>.py -h
```


Note that you must use the right token for the right entrypoint URL.
